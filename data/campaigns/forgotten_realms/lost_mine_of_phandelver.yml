name: "Lost Mine of Phandelver"
description: |
  A classic fantasy adventure set on the edge of civilization, where danger and opportunity lie just beyond the hills.
  What starts as a simple job — escorting a wagon to the frontier town of Phandalin — quickly leads to a deeper mystery. 
  Bandits stalk the roads, strange creatures prowl the forests, and the locals speak in hushed tones of ancient ruins and long-lost secrets buried beneath the earth.
  Phandalin becomes your base of operations, a town filled with colorful characters, hidden dangers, and quests that pull you deeper into the region’s past. 
  From goblin hideouts to haunted ruins, your party will explore, fight, and shape the future of a land on the brink of change.
  Gather your party, prepare your gear, and step into a land of peril and opportunity.
  The frontier calls.
