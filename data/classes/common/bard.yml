  Humming as she traces her fingers over an ancient monument in a long-forgotten ruin, a half-elf 
  in rugged leathers finds knowledge springing into her mind, conjured forth by the magic of her song.
  
  A stern human warrior barks commands to rally his comrades into battle, his voice magically infused 
  with vigor and bravery.
  
  Laughing, a gnome twirls a dagger and launches into a raucous tale of heroism, subtly weaving in 
  enchantments to charm the crowd.

  lore, and their commanding presence.
