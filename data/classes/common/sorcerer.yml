  A human's eyes glow with arcane light as lightning dances across his fingertips.

  A dragonborn lifts into the air on fiery wings, her bloodline pulsing with magical power.

  A tiefling grins as reality warps around her, a chaotic storm answering her call without incantation.

  Sorcerers possess magic in their blood—innate power granted by birth, heritage, or some strange twist of fate. They shape spells through sheer will and instinct, channeling raw arcane energy in flexible and explosive ways.
