  A bald human moves like a blur across the battlefield, fists striking with pinpoint precision.

  A halfling balances on a bamboo stalk, redirecting an ogre's club with graceful ease.

  A tiefling inhales deeply, then vanishes from view, reappearing behind her foe with a focused strike.

  Monks are ascetic warriors who channel mystical energy called ki to perform superhuman feats. Unarmored 
  and swift, they strike with blinding speed and evade danger through discipline and self-perfection.
