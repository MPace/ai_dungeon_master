  A half-elf whispers forbidden words under his breath, calling forth eldritch fire from the shadows.

  A tiefling’s eyes glow with pact-born fury as she utters a curse, her voice echoing with power not her own.

  A human traces a sigil midair, summoning a raven to her side and commanding it in a voice like distant thunder.

  Warlocks channel power from mysterious patrons—beings beyond comprehension that forge magical pacts with mortals. Whether for ambition, revenge, or survival, warlocks trade service for magic, wielding arcane abilities fueled by their pact.
