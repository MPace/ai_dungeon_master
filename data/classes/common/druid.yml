  Holding aloft a staff wreathed in thorns, an elf chants in Druidic, summoning vines to ensnare a charging beast.

  A halfling whispers to the trees, and the forest answers, cloaking her in fog and shadows as she disappears.

  A dragonborn snarls and twists, her form collapsing and reforming into that of a massive dire wolf.

  Druids are wielders of primal magic, drawing their power from the natural world and the elements. Guardians 
  of balance, they shapechange into beasts, command fire and ice, and defend sacred groves from corruption.
