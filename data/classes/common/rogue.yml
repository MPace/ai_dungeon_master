  A half-elf picks a lock with delicate precision, sliding into a vault without making a sound.

  A halfling vanishes into the crowd, her mark clutching his side as the blade disappears just as quickly as it struck.

  A tiefling leaps from a rooftop, dagger flashing under moonlight as she delivers a critical blow.

  Rogues are masters of stealth, agility, and cunning. Whether operating in the shadows, striking with deadly precision, or talking their way through trouble, they thrive where others falter. They rely on quick thinking, skill mastery, and sudden, devastating strikes.
