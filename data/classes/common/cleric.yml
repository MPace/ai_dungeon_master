  Clutching a holy symbol, a dwarf kneels behind a wall of shields, calling on the gods to heal the 
  wounded around him. Radiant light mends torn flesh and broken bones.

  A half-elf raises her shield high, divine energy pulsing outward as the undead recoil in fear. 
  Chanting ancient rites, she banishes darkness with holy power.

  A tiefling mutters a prayer through gritted teeth as flames erupt from her fingers, burning her enemies 
  in righteous fury.

  Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the divine. As varied 
  as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the ideals of their deity through healing, protection, 
  and destruction alike.
