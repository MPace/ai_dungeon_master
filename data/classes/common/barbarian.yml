description: |
  A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs 
  as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people's elk herd.
  
  A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to 
  break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals.
  
  Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to 
  drive his armored elbow into the gut of another.
  
  These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, 
  and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, 
  the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.

  level1:
    - name: Rage
      type: active
      uses: 2  # Times per long rest at level 1
      description: |
        In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
        
        While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:
        • You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
        • When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.
        • You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
        
        Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.
    
    - name: Unarmored Defense
      type: passive
      description: |
        While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
  
  level2:
    - name: Reckless Attack
      type: active
      description: |
        When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.
    
    - name: Danger Sense
      type: passive
      description: |
        You gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

  level3:
    - name: Primal Path
      type: choice  # This is a subclass choice
      description: |
        You choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the class description.
      options:
        - id: berserker
          name: Path of the Berserker
          description: |
            For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.
          features:
            - name: Frenzy
              type: active
              description: |
                You can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion.
        
        - id: totem_warrior
          name: Path of the Totem Warrior
          description: |
            The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.
          features:
            - name: Spirit Seeker
              type: passive
              description: |
                Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. You gain the ability to cast the Beast Sense and Speak with Animals spells, but only as rituals.
            
            - name: Totem Spirit
              type: choice
              description: |
                At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object—an amulet or similar adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal.
              options:
                - id: bear
                  name: Bear
                  description: |
                    While raging, you have resistance to all damage except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to stand up to any punishment.
                
                - id: eagle
                  name: Eagle
                  description: |
                    While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray with ease.
                
                - id: wolf
                  name: Wolf
                  description: |
                    While you're raging, your friends have advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.

        Alternatively, you can choose a feat.
