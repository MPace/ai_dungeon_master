description: |
  Half-orcs inherit the strength and ferocity of their orcish blood, tempered by human adaptability. 
  Often seen as intimidating, they are powerful allies and formidable foes. Many half-orcs find their 
  place in warrior societies, gladiatorial pits, or mercenary bands, but others seek redemption, 
  respect, or their own path in a world that judges by appearances.

  With sharpened instincts and unmatched endurance, half-orcs thrive in battle and rarely go down 
  without a fight.
