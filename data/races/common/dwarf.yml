  Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though short 
  in stature, they are mighty in heart and legacy. Their strongholds echo with hammer strikes and ancient 
  songs passed down for generations.

  Dwarves value honor, tradition, and loyalty above all. Their communities are tight-knit, and they take pride 
  in crafting tools and weapons that last for centuries. Whether carving runes, crafting ale, or fighting orcs, 
  dwarves meet life with unwavering grit.
