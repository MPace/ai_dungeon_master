  Tieflings bear the mark of their infernal heritageâ€”horns, tails, glowing eyes, and skin in shades of 
  red, purple, or even blue. Though the blood of devils flows through their veins, tieflings are mortal, 
  with free will and complex identities.

  Often judged by appearance alone, many tieflings struggle for acceptance or carve their own paths 
  as rebels, outcasts, or champions of those who live in the margins. Their legacy grants them natural 
  charisma, magical aptitude, and a fire that burns just beneath the surface.
