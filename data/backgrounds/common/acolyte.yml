# Suggested characteristics
suggestedCharacteristics:
  personalityTraits:
    - I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person's deeds and example.
    - I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace.
    - I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen.
    - Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude.
  ideals:
    - Tradition. The ancient traditions of worship and sacrifice must be preserved and upheld. (Lawful)
    - Charity. I always try to help those in need, no matter what the personal cost. (Good)
    - Power. I hope to one day rise to the top of my faith's religious hierarchy. (Lawful)
    - Faith. I trust that my deity will guide my actions. I have faith that if I work hard, things will go well. (Lawful)
  bonds:
    - I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago.
    - I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me a heretic.
    - I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents died.
    - Everything I do is for the common people.
  flaws:
    - I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely.
    - I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy.
    - My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god.
    - I am inflexible in my thinking.
