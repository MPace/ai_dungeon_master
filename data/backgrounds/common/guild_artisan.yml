  name: Guild Membership
  description: |
    As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership 
    provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for 
    your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other 
    members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet contacts or patrons. You must pay 
    5 gp per month in dues to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in good standing.
