  You lived in seclusion—either in a sheltered community such as a monastery or entirely alone—for a 
  formative part of your life. In your time apart from the clamor of society, you found quiet, solitude, 
  and perhaps a great truth. This background suits a variety of hermits, from ascetics and prophets 
  to researchers and spiritual seekers.

# Feature
feature:
  name: Discovery
  description: |
    The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. 
    The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great 
    truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. 
    It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been 
    forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information 
    that would be damaging to the people who or consort with the powerful.

# Suggested characteristics
suggestedCharacteristics:
  personalityTraits:
    - I’ve been isolated for so long that I rarely speak, preferring gestures and the occasional grunt.
    - I am utterly serene, even in the face of disaster.
    - I’m oblivious to etiquette and social expectations.
    - I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, becoming oblivious to my surroundings.
  ideals:
    - Greater Good. My gifts are meant to be shared with all, not used for my own benefit. (Good)
    - Logic. Emotions must not cloud our sense of what is right and true, or our logical thinking. (Lawful)

  bonds:
    - Nothing is more important than the other members of my hermitage, order, or association.
    - I entered seclusion to hide from the ones who might still be hunting me. I must someday confront them.
    - I’m still seeking the enlightenment I pursued in my seclusion, and it still eludes me.
    - I created a great work for someone, and I want to find them and ensure it’s appreciated.
  flaws:
    - Now that I’ve returned to the world, I enjoy its delights a little too much.
    - I harbor dark, bloodthirsty thoughts that my isolation and meditation failed to quell.
