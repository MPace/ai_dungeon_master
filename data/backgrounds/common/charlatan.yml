# Suggested characteristics
suggestedCharacteristics:
  personalityTraits:
    - I fall in and out of love easily, and am always pursuing someone.
    - I have a joke for every occasion, especially occasions where humor is inappropriate.
    - I lie about almost everything, even when there’s no good reason to.
    - I keep multiple holy symbols on me and invoke whatever deity might come in useful at any given moment.
  ideals:
    - Independence. I am a free spirit—no one tells me what to do. (Chaotic)
    - Fairness. I never target people who can’t afford to lose a few coins. (Lawful)
    - Charity. I distribute the money I acquire to the people who really need it. (Good)
    - Creativity. I never run the same con twice. (Chaotic)
  bonds:
    - I fleeced the wrong person and must work to ensure that this individual never crosses paths with me again.
    - I owe everything to my mentor—a horrible person who’s probably rotting in jail somewhere.
    - Somewhere out there, I have a child who doesn’t know me. I’m making the world better for them.
    - I come from a noble family, and one day I’ll reclaim my lands and title from those who stole them from me.
  flaws:
    - I can’t resist swindling people who are more powerful than me.
    - I’m always in debt. I spend my ill-gotten gains on decadent luxuries faster than I bring them in.
    - I’m convinced that no one could ever fool me the way I fool others.
    - I can’t resist a pretty face.
