  You understand wealth, power, and privilege. You carry a noble title, and your family owns land, collects 
  taxes, and wields significant political influence. You might be a pampered aristocrat or a displaced heir 
  working to reclaim your birthright—or anything in between.

  Even though you might not wield personal power, your noble birth opens doors and demands respect in 
  high society.

    Thanks to your noble birth, people are inclined to think the best of you. You are welcome in high society, 
    and people assume you have the right to be wherever you are. The common folk make every effort to 
    accommodate you and avoid your displeasure, and other people of high birth treat you as a member of the 
    same social sphere. You can secure an audience with a local noble if you need to.
