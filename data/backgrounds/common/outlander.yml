# Suggested characteristics
suggestedCharacteristics:

    - I’m driven by a wanderlust that led me away from home.
    - I watch over my friends as if they were a litter of newborn pups.
    - I place no stock in wealthy or well-mannered folk. Money and manners won’t save you from a hungry owlbear.
    - I feel far more comfortable around animals than people.
  ideals:
    - Change. Life is like the seasons, in constant change, and we must change with it. (Chaotic)
    - Greater Good. It is each person’s responsibility to make the most happiness for the whole tribe. (Good)
    - Glory. I must earn glory in battle, for myself and my clan. (Any)

  bonds:
    - My family, clan, or tribe is the most important thing in my life, even when they are far from me.
    - An injury to the unspoiled wilderness of my home is an injury to me.
    - I will bring terrible wrath down on the evildoers who destroyed my homeland.
    - I am the last of my tribe, and it is up to me to ensure their names enter legend.

    - I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants.
    - There’s no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest.
    - I remember every insult I’ve received and nurse a silent resentment toward anyone who’s ever wronged me.
    - I am slow to trust members of other races, tribes, and societies.
