feature:
  name: By Popular Demand
  description: |
    You can always find a place to perform, usually in an inn or tavern but possibly with a circus, at a 
    theater, or even in a noble’s court. At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or 
    comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. 
    In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. Strangers may recognize you in a 
    town where you have performed.

# Suggested characteristics
suggestedCharacteristics:
  personalityTraits:
    - I know a story relevant to almost every situation.
    - Whenever I come to a new place, I collect local rumors and spread gossip.
    - I’m a hopeless romantic, always searching for “that special someone.”
    - Nobody stays angry at me or around me for long, since I can defuse any amount of tension.
  ideals:
    - Beauty. When I perform, I make the world better than it was. (Good)
    - Tradition. The stories, legends, and songs of the past must never be forgotten. (Lawful)
    - Creativity. The world is in need of new ideas and bold action. (Chaotic)
    - Honesty. Art should reflect the soul; it should come from within and reveal who we really are. (Neutral)
  bonds:
    - My instrument is my most treasured possession, and it reminds me of someone I love.
    - Someone stole my precious instrument, and someday I’ll get it back.
    - I want to be famous, whatever it takes.
    - I idolize a hero of the old tales and measure my deeds against theirs.
  flaws:
    - I’ll do anything to win fame and renown.
    - I’m a sucker for a pretty face.
    - A scandal prevents me from ever going home again. That kind of trouble seems to follow me around.
    - I once satirized a noble who still wants my head. It was a mistake that I will likely repeat.
