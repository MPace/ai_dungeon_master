  War has been your life for as long as you can remember. You trained as a youth, studied the rules of battle, 
  and fought on the front lines. Whether for a kingdom, a mercenary company, or a rebel cause, you’ve seen 
  combat and learned how to survive it.

  You might have risen through the ranks, or perhaps you fled your duties. Regardless, your experience in 
  military life shapes your actions and your sense of order.

feature:
  name: Military Rank
  description: |
    You have a military rank from your career as a soldier. Soldiers loyal to your former military 
    organization still recognize your authority and influence, and they defer to you if they are of 
    a lower rank. You can invoke your rank to exert influence over other soldiers and requisition 
    simple equipment or horses for temporary use. You can also gain access to friendly military 
    encampments and fortresses where your rank is recognized.
