# Suggested characteristics
suggestedCharacteristics:
  personalityTraits:
    - I always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong.
    - I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.
    - I don’t pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.
    - The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can’t do it.
  ideals:
    - Honor. I don’t steal from others in the trade. (Lawful)
    - Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic)
    - Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good)
    - Redemption. There’s a spark of good in everyone. (Good)
  bonds:
    - I’m trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.
    - My ill-gotten gains go to support my family.
    - Someone I loved died because of a mistake I made. That will never happen again.
    - I will become the greatest thief that ever lived.
  flaws:
    - When I see something valuable, I can’t think about anything but how to steal it.
    - When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.
    - If there’s a plan, I’ll forget it. If I don’t forget it, I’ll ignore it.
    - An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I’m okay with that.
