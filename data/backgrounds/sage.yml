    When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you don’t know that information, you often 
    know where and from whom you can obtain it. Usually, this information comes from a library, scriptorium, 
    university, or a sage or other learned person or creature. Your DM might rule that the knowledge you seek 
    is secreted away in an almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be found.
